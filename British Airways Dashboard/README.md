## Charts:
1. A line graph showing the trend of the overall rating over time from 2016 to 2023. Ratings appear to fluctuate with noticeable peaks and troughs, particularly post-2020.
2. A map visual shows the distribution of average ratings by country. Darker shades likely indicate higher ratings, while lighter shades represent lower ratings.
3. A bar chart displays the average overall rating for different aircraft models, with color shading representing the rating (darker green = higher rating). It also includes a bar showing the number of reviews per aircraft model (indicated by the horizontal pink bars).

## Insights:

1. Overall Ratings: The average overall rating is 4.2, but certain service aspects like "Entertainment" (1.4) and "Food Beverages" (2.4) show significantly lower scores.
2. Ratings by Aircraft: The Boeing 747-400 has the highest rating (4.7), while the A321 has the lowest (3.6). The A320 has the highest number of reviews (329), which could indicate it’s a widely used aircraft for British Airways.
3. Geographical Distribution: There’s global coverage of ratings, though reviews from countries in Europe, the U.S., and parts of Asia seem more prevalent.
4. Temporal Trends: The ratings have generally fluctuated over time, with a notable drop around 2020-2021, possibly due to the pandemic's impact on service.
